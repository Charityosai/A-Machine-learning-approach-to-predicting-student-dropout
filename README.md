Title: A Machine learning approach to predicting student dropout

This study aims to contribute to the improvement of academic dropout by exploring the 
application of machine learning techniques to train a classifier that will predict if a student is 
likely to drop out. The model can be used by academic institutions to identify and support 
students at risk and provide timely support intervention. 

The chosen dataset was obtained from the UCI repository. The dataset contains 4424 student 
records that relate to information known at the time of student enrolment i.e., academic path, 
demographics, and social-economic factors. It also consists of 36 attributes (independent 
variable) and one Target variable (dependent variable). The categorical attributes were already
label encoded to numerical variables prior to downloading the dataset.
